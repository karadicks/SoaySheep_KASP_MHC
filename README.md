**MHC class IIa haplotypes derived by high throughput SNP screening in an isolated sheep population.** Kara Dicks, Josephine Pemberton, Keith Ballingall and Susan Johnston


## Summary

This repository contains the raw data and scripts used for converting raw KASP genotypes into MHC haplotypes in the St Kilda population of Soay sheep (*Ovis aries*). 

`scripts/Convert_KASP_to_MHC_Haplotypes.R` contains the workflow to convert the raw genotypes into MHC haplotypes.  

`data/KASP_formatted.txt` contains the raw genotype data.  
`data/Ref_MHC_haplotypes.txt` contains the reference SNP haplotypes
`data/SangerOnlyHaplos.txt` contains the additional Sanger haplotypes generated by [Dicks et al (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00251-019-01109-w)
